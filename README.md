# 🧰 DataKit SDK

DataKit is a PHP-based abstraction
around [`@wordpress/dataviews`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-dataviews/).
It provides an easy-to-understand way of composing `DataViews`-based applications, with a set of default field types and
rendering.

DataKit is also built to be extended by you with ease. You can [create your own `DataSource`](https://docs.datakit.org/SDK/Data-sources/create-a-data-source) or [invent your own `Field`](https://docs.datakit.org/SDK/Fields/using-fields).

We have _many_ docs available, including:
