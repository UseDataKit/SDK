## Hello, world!

DataKit is a PHP SDK that allows you to easily create DataViews from a variety of data sources. It is designed to be 
flexible and easy to use, while providing a powerful set of tools to create the views you need.

### This documentation is split into two parts:

## The [SDK](SDK/creating-dataviews)

The SDK has the primitives to create a DataView, and the fields that are part of it. The SDK is designed to be 
platform-agnostic, so you can use it in any PHP project.

## The [WordPress Plugin](Plugin/getting-started)

The WordPress plugin extends the SDK create the DataViews. Moving forward, the plugin will provide a UI to create and 
manage views.

The plugin includes additional [DataSource](/docs/DataSource/10-intro) implementations, including WordPress Users, 
Attachments, Gravity Forms, and WS Form.
