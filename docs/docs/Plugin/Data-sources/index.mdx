# Data Sources in the WordPress plugin

The DataKit SDK comes with default data sources that are platform-agnostic: ([see the SDK Data Sources](/SDK/Data-sources/)).

## WordPress Data Sources

The DataKit WordPress plugin adds data sources that integrate with WordPress and WordPress plugins. These data sources are:

- [WS Form](/Plugin/Data-sources/ws-form)
- Gravity Forms
- WordPress Users
- WordPress Attachments (currently CSV)

Documentation is coming soon for these data sources.
